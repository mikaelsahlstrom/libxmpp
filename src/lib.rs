//! `libxmpp` is a small async XMPP client library built on Tokio.
//!
//! It currently supports connecting to an XMPP server with STARTTLS and
//! SASL authentication, joining and leaving Multi-User Chat (MUC) rooms,
//! sending and receiving group messages, and exchanging one-to-one chat
//! messages. Server events are delivered as [`XmppEvent`] values on an
//! [`mpsc::Receiver`] returned from [`XmppClient::new`].
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use xmpp::{XmppClient, XmppEvent};
//!
//! # async fn run() -> Result<(), String> {
//! let (mut client, mut events) =
//!     XmppClient::new("user@example.com", "password").await?;
//!
//! client.join_room("room@conference.example.com", "my-nick").await?;
//!
//! while let Some(event) = events.recv().await
//! {
//!     match event
//!     {
//!         XmppEvent::RoomMessage { room, nick, body, .. } =>
//!         {
//!             println!("[{}] {}: {}", room, nick, body);
//!         }
//!         XmppEvent::DirectMessage { from, body, .. } =>
//!         {
//!             println!("{} -> {}", from, body);
//!         }
//!         _ => {}
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! client.close().await;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
